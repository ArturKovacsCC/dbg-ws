## Overview

In this workshop you'll find examples that should highlight some
of the common mistakes that are made in the web module.

The tasks start with short examples, and later move on to a
slighly more complex issue that you'll learn how to debug.

## Usage

Before each task, it's advised to (re)start the server.

You can run the server with
```
npm run dev
```

You can find the tasks in the `public` folder. Each task consists of two files: X.html and X.js.

For example, to work on the first task, visit the `http://localhost:3005/1.html` page and follow the instructions in the `1.js` file.
