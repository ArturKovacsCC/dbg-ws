## Usage

Before each task, it's advised to (re)start the server.

You can run the server with
```
npm run dev
```

Each task consists of two files: X.html and X.js.

For example, to work on the first task, visit the `http://localhost:3005/1.html` page and follow the instructions in the `1.js` file.
